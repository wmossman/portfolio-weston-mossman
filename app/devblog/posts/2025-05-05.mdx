# Time Spent

5 hours

# Outcomes & Reflections

Delivered an interactive Climate Week talk that left students energized to craft their own 7-Word Why Stories.

Balanced grief over mentor Michael’s terminal diagnosis with leading Liminal Space’s Fallen Pollen installation at Burning Man.

Created my own 7-Word Why Story: **Playground proves capability, showcases spirit, invites collaboration.**

Defined personas and mapped a prioritized feature list before writing any code.

# Field Journal

## Climate Week Reflection

The UCSC talk on “7-Word Why Stories” went incredibly well—students brainstormed better futures and found personal guiding lights.

## Personal Loss

Minutes after meeting a Westside makerspace owner, I learned my mentor Michael has only months to live. Michael taught me guitar since age nine and shaped my life. Plans to surprise-visit him in Phoenix were overtaken by fate.

## Fallen Pollen at Burning Man

Led a 4-month build with a 12-person team through flawless logistics, solarpunk programming, and nightly 8-hour sleep—proof that immersive art and high performance coexist.

## 7-Word Why Story Breakdown

### **Topic**

My Weston Mossman Portfolio

### **Ideal World**

A public playground for writing, sharing, learning, experimenting, and connecting—reflecting creativity, speed, and impact.

### **7-Word Story**

_Playground proves capability, showcases spirit, invites collaboration._

## Implementation Sprint

With Copilot’s help, scaffolded a Projects grid & detail page in Next.js, wrote tests, and iterated to green in hours.

## AI Pitfalls & Next Steps

Noticed Copilot over-uses `as any`; prioritizing stronger TypeScript typings as the top P1 task.
