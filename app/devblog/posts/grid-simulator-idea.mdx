## Time Spent

2 hours

## Outcomes & Reflections

Outlined grid simulator with real-world market + weather prediction data.

Mapped gameplay layers tied to peak pricing and energy flows.

Created consulting narratives for reuse in outreach and partnerships.

## Unfinished Tasks

Build MVP UI for battery map visualization.

Design energy-price gameplay loops with forecast modeling.

## Field Journal

Getting really excited to make something relevant and potentially helpful even if in a small way for grid calculations for my portfolio. I’m targeting Gridmatic like crazy here as I would absolutely love to work there, and also it would be great just to show potential connections at sustainability events, or other potential companies.

Todd and I brainstormed a simulation that uses CAISO historical energy market data and PG&E metering rates, combining it with AWS or GCP ML tools for regression-based energy predictions. With 10 years of weather and price data, we’d forecast daily cycles, optimizing battery buys and sells.

We designed a game element: players operate a virtual grid with peak multipliers, install costs, time delays, and limited battery choices—trying to buy low, sell high, and forecast efficiently. One day equals one month, and you can acquire more batteries to grow.

I also updated some consulting pitch ideas—like Joe who lost $6k on Fiverr before hiring me to redo his site. Other contacts: Matt Berger, Cruzio, and NextSpace. I’m preparing a short proposal that could bring recurring $10k value. Resume notes updated to show Liminal’s leadership scope.
