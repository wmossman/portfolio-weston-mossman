summary: 'Short PRD for an interactive tool that quantifies curtailment, and shows battery-enabled profit & CO₂ savings per battery size.'

I was pretty excited by the project idea the other day with Todd, and have been having great conversations with local solar/battery grid decarbonization friends. My project plan has shifted from a battery price map to something more useful: **an interactive CAISO SP15 ideal charge time engine, revenue calculator, and curtailment dissipation reduction system.**

I'll start with mock data and just focus on the charge time optimiser and the graphs, then expand from there into real data, ML, user-impacted price and curtailment, and decarbonization calculator.

Here is a short PRD of what I am planning:

## Purpose

Build a concise demo that proves how grid-scale batteries turn “duck-curve” oversupply into revenue and avoided emissions.  
The tool doubles as a practice project and a realistic and useful conversation starter.

## Goals

- Predict next-day duck-curve depth (MW and hour).
- Visualise optimal battery charge window, avoided curtailment (MWh / kg CO₂).
- Display net cost / revenue vs. naïve average-price charging.
- Learn about curtailment, refresh D3, and have fun!

## Scope

### In

- Hourly LMP (mock first, real data later) for SP15.
- Greedy optimiser (upgradeable to MILP).
- Three synced D3 graphs (forecast, curtailment, cost).

### Out

- Real-time updates or multi-node expansion.
- Ancillary-services co-optimisation.
- UI for battery degradation cost (future phase).

## Deliverables

1. **Graph A – Forecast** – LMP line, battery charge line, curtailment band.
2. **Graph B – Curtailment Dissipation** – energy lost with / without battery.
3. **Graph C – Net Cost** – cost / revenue vs. average-price baseline.

## Data Sources

- CAISO OASIS DAM & RTM LMP (XML).
- CAISO net-demand & fuel-mix for carbon factor.
- Mock CSVs to unblock front-end work and as fallback.

## Architecture

Hourly CAISO data (or mock CSV) flows through a Next.js API route.

An optimiser computes the charge schedule, and the results feed three D3 graphs rendered in the client.

## Phases & Timeline

- **Day 5** – Mock data, greedy charge time optimiser, three D3 graphs at `/simulator/curtailment`.
- **Day 10** – CAISO fetch API + RTK Query wiring.
- **Day 15** – LightGBM year-long ML regression preprocess, swap in forecasted duck-curve depth.
- **Expansions** – Upgrade to MILP optimiser, implement variable grid price that increases in response to high charge speed, show carbon-factor overlays.
