# Time Spent

1 hour

# Outcomes & Reflections

Finalized “Injecting a healthy dose of ‘WHY’ into the ‘HOW’” talk for UCSC Climate Week.

Recognized that engineers, EMs, and PMs will merge into a purpose-first, AI-powered hybrid role.

Reaffirmed that defining “Why” before “How” anchors product purpose, metrics, and optimization.

# Roadmap & Next Steps

### **Why Statement**

Draft a guiding “Why” for the portfolio.

### **Goals & Personas**

Define product goals tied to target personas.

### **Feature Alignment**

Map goals to features and prioritize backlog.

### **Metrics Setup**

Create simple survey metrics per feature.

### **PRD & Timeline**

Generate a PRD and feed to Copilot for a micro-agile timeline.

### **Vibe Coding**

Execute features one-by-one via AI-assisted development.

# Field Journal

### Presentation Prep

Tomorrow I present at UCSC Baskin Engineering for Climate Week: “Injecting a healthy dose of ‘WHY’ into the ‘HOW’.”

Too often we ask “how?” before “why?”. In my years of engineering, design, product, team-building, and art, “Why” has become the guiding question:

Why am I making this feature?

What are these tests really testing for?

Why am I learning this?

Why am I working at this company?

### Implementation Pause

Today is dedicated to drafting and practicing—not coding.

### Vibe Coding Realization

Yesterday’s AI pair-programming (“Vibe Coding”) crystallized the future: spend most time on “Why,” then leverage AI to ship and AB-test features rapidly.

### Optimization Mantra

1. Know what you’re making.

2. Know who you’re making it for.

3. Measure and optimize in production with real users.
