## Field Journal

Look at that, another huge gap! Two things.

One, my partner Tiffany and I went on a week long NO LAPTOPS trip to Santa Fe to truly engage with the community, the art, and Santa Fe’s unique geography. And of course each other! I was truly amazed by Santa Fe’s timeless beauty, the diversity of the art, the authenticity and support of native art, and the seemingly thriving art economy. The architecture, modelled after the area’s historic Pueblo homes, seem to emerge from the earth like outcroppings of rock, the structures nodding their head to the majesty of the surrounding land rather than imposing themselves as greater than nature. Having connected with a number of Meow Wolf and post-Meow Wolf artists, creators, and leaders in the previous months, I was essentially adopted by a wonderful community, and already began building connections between them in my week there, suddenly feeling as though I have a solid group of talented, kind and kindred friends in Santa Fe. I will definitely be going back soon.

Two, I mentioned in the last entry that my mentor, guitar teacher, and second father Michael was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. Unfortunately, the night before I arrived in Phoenix to spend time with him, he passed. Months earlier than expected. This has been a pretty significant shift and shock. I spent the latter half of last week in Phoenix spending time with Michael’s wife Cathy, helping out with things around the house, looking into the will, fixing guitars, and jamming on guitar by myself wishing Michael were there with me. On the second night, I found out one of his pedals which he gave to me in his will had a looper feature. So of course I laid down a loop, and suddenly Michael was there. My playing is so similar to his. Even though his spirit may have left this plane of existence, his essence lives on in the hearts and minds of so many, and the music I will keep creating until I leave this world too.

I will still be learning lessons from this teacher of mine for years to come.

Phew. So while I have this time before I take my partner Tiffany to the airport for her Mexico trip, let’s get back into planning for this portfolio.

Looking up at my prioritization post, I’m reminded of how important clear and near-term project missions, roadmaps and task lists are. I instantly know exactly what is next.

I noticed a bug in the MD renderer, it seems to be having an issue rendering tables. I’ll step through the table rendering code to see if it’s even getting there, and figure things out. BUT should I jump to this? NO! Putting it on the stack as a P0 bug.
