## Time Spent

4 hours

## Outcomes & Reflections

- Web3Forms is awesome and free
- What am I doing putting my email on the internet?
- Don't I know that is a terrible idea?
- The answer: I love spam emails.

## Unfinished Tasks

- None for this project right now!

## Field Journal

The irony wasn't lost on me. Here I was, literally asking an AI agent to help me remove my email address from the internet because I'd finally realized what a terrible idea it was to have it sitting there in plain text. Classic developer move: solve the problem I created by building a more complex solution.

The whole thing started when I looked at my portfolio and thought, "Wait, do I really want every bot and scraper on the internet to have my email?" The answer was a resounding no. But I still wanted people to be able to reach me easily.

### Enter Web3Forms

I researched contact form solutions that would work with my Next.js app on Cloudflare without requiring a backend, tapping on Copilot for some options. Web3Forms emerged as the clear winner - completely free, no registration required, just drop in an access key and you're golden.

The implementation was surprisingly smooth. Copilot and I built a full ContactForm component with:
- Name, Email, Subject, and "Questions & Ideas" fields
- Custom subject line formatting (`"Portfolio Form - [user subject]"`)
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and state management
- Error handling and success states
- A reusable Label component with red asterisks for required fields
- Used my existing Button component for consistency

### Web3Forms is amazing
Grabbed the key from Web3Forms, dropped it in `.env.local`, and boom - garbage test submissions sent from myself landed right in my inbox - with clean non-garbage formatting. Thank you to all of the paid Web3Forms customers for subsidizing the free version for me.

Simple as that.

### hCaptcha Integration

So if I have learned anything, it's that spam is not the most good thing there is in the array of things there are in the world. So let's add hCaptcha. `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` ftw:
- Free with Web3Forms' shared site key
- Privacy-focused
- Dark mode React component that fits the `aesthetic`
- Client-side validation for great justice

And voila:

### Navigation and UX Polish

So now to get it on the app:
- Tossed it at the bottom of the landing page
- Created a dedicated `/contact` page with both the form and a Calendly scheduling section
- Added "Contact" to the main navigation (both desktop and mobile) and footer

The contact page flow makes sense: quick questions via form, complex discussions via scheduled call.

### Turtles All The Way Down

There's something intriguingly recursive about collaborating with an AI agent to help me build a contact form so people can reach me about potentially working with AI agents to build and tune AI agents. The future is weird. 

With regards to Copilot's recent Agent Mode updates, I'm pretty stoked about having more time to focus on the vision and design. When I get down to coding it's mostly a PRD and software architecture exercise: how well can I convey what I want to get the best output in the shortest time, while learning in the process? Hit enter, oversee some super fast implementation, fix Copilot's mistakes, then work alongside Copilot for a quick refactor to make the code as good, if not better, than if I had written it alone. I'm still learning, but instead of memorizing, cheat-sheeting, and frantically searching when I forget, I'm letting Copliot write most of the boilerplate and reviewing to make sure the patterns are high quality.

The whole implementation took about 3 hours from conception to deployment-ready. That includes research, component-building, implementation, testing, and polish. Not bad for a complete contact solution with spam protection.

Now instead of feeding my email to the spam bots, I have a professional contact flow that is about 10x UX points above a mailto link.

Sometimes the best creations come from admitting you made a mistake and building something better.
