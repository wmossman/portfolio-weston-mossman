Want to learn more about how I implemented the landing page 3D hero?

### The Inspiration

Ria Chockalingam, who was an audience member at the Adobe Creative Cafe where I was a panelist, inspired me to create a Three.js hero after I saw the interactive 3D hero she made for another art collective. She just became a Liminal Space member, and when I showed her my portfolio and told her how she inspired me, she asked how I made it. I wrote this up for her, so I figured I might as well turn it into a devblog for everyone!

### The Design Process

This project was mostly a design, creative direction, and product requirements exercise. The key questions were:
- **Why?** What does this hero need to communicate about me?
- **How?** How does the visual design convey those messages?

The answers led to a network visualization - something that feels technical, interconnected, and alive. Perfect for showcasing both technical skill and creative vision.

### Technical Implementation Journey

The implementation involved **very quickly relearning Three.js** while collaborating with Copilot to iteratively work through the PRD. This meant lots of learning about:
- Meshes and geometries
- Trigonometry for 3D space
- Performance optimizations
- React Three Fiber patterns

Copilot helped tremendously with learning and general bugfixes, while I provided guidance, caught when Copilot generated questionable code, and made my own changes when I had specific creative vision. Knowing the general best practices for architecture really helped prevent Copilot from generating complete garbage.

### The Core Architecture

#### Node System
The foundation is a 3D volume that scales roughly to screen size. Within this volume, nodes are generated at random XYZ coordinates. These nodes are represented visually by green spheres that **POP** into existence with particle effects.

Each node has:
- A lifetime with multiple stages
- A dictionary of connected nodes
- Connection-seeking behavior at specific life stages

#### Connection Algorithm
When nodes try to connect to others, they:
1. Check all existing nodes using `threejs.distance()`
2. Use randomness and statistics based on existing connections
3. Form connections to 1-5 nodes at a time

Connections are separate visual entities that render between connected nodes. They don't have independent lifetimes - they fade out and die with their oldest connected node.

#### Visual Effects
Connections start as cylinders with zero height and scale based on distance between nodes at a static speed. They include particles at the leading edge, and the direction goes from the connecting node **toward** the target node.

### The Mouse Magic

The camera system uses mouse position to move the camera in Y and Z directions while always looking at (0,0,0). The creative part was solving the jarring snap when moving the mouse out of the canvas and back in.

I implemented an invisible "physics pixel" that accelerates and decelerates toward the mouse position, creating smooth tweening. Much more pleasant than instant snapping.

### Post-Processing Beauty

I added an Unreal Engine-style bloom plugin that scales luminosity for nodes based on their connection count. This creates some really beautiful visuals where highly connected nodes become bright focal points in the network.

### React Three Fiber Conversion

The final step was converting everything to React Three Fiber, which is **fucking awesome** because it's all just React hooks. This made it easy to:
- Componentize the entire system
- Optimize with `useMemo` and other React patterns
- Maintain clean, declarative code
- Leverage the React ecosystem

### Performance Philosophy

Being a good little engineer, I frst implemented dynamic resolution scaling for mobile. But it was kinda ugly, so I said "fuck it - give them max resolution, and if it's slow on their device, that's a skill issue." Beauty over lowest common denominator FPS for this bad boy.

Sometimes the right choice for a portfolio piece is to prioritize visual impact over universal performance. This hero is meant to showcase technical and creative capability, not run at 144fps on a potato.

### The Result

A nice 3D interactive landing page hero that is:
- **Pretty** - Visual appeal draws people in
- **Intriguing** - Interactive elements encourage exploration  
- **Personal** - Conveys vital elements of my personality and mission

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture First**: Having a clear mental model prevented Copilot from generating architectural disasters
2. **React Three Fiber**: Modern composable, memoizeable React system makes 3D development, organization and optimization much more approachable
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Sometimes beauty over small performance gains is the right call for portfolio pieces
4. **Collaboration**: Human guidance + AI assistance is incredibly powerful for learning new domains

And there you have it! A nice 3D interactive landing page hero that captures attention and interest while showcasing capability. Hope you like it!
