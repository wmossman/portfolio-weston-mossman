## New Tech ↔ Shippable Products

I spent today balancing my curiosity for new frameworks with the imperative to build something I can actually ship. A simple click‑counter demo is fun, sure—but what if I spend an extra ten minutes and call it a **Visitor High Five Counter**, complete with a daily quota and a backend? Suddenly it’s not just an exercise, it’s a genuine feature someone might actually use.

### Ideas on the Table

- **AI Lead‑Gen Chatbot**  
  Train a chatbot on my own voice, experience, and offerings to capture leads.

  - Gemini or ChatGPT integration
  - Conversation processing to generate actionable follow‑ups
  - Data stored in DynamoDB

- **Visitor High Five**  
  A lighthearted counter that tracks one “high five” per visitor per day.

  - Minimal backend
  - AWS AppSync (GraphQL)
  - DynamoDB

- **HTML Canvas Mini‑Game**  
  Embed a little mission‑themed game—drop an icon into a box and get routed to that page.

- **Feedback & Testimonials Carousel**  
  Front‑end only, but a polished way to showcase quotes without reinventing the wheel.

- **Sticky Left Nav with Physics Bounce**  
  A nav that pops out, bounces, and causes nearby images or icons to oscillate—just enough whimsy to keep people awake.

## Converting the Template into My Own

- **Magic Numbers → Constants**  
  No more guessing what `42` means in my code.
- **Content Folder**  
  Move text out of JSX and into a `/content` directory so I can iterate on writing without touching components.
- **Link Management**  
  Centralize all URLs, social links, and resume links so I can update them in one place.

## Defining Base Necessities (in Priority Order)

1. **Landing Page**  
   Hero images, clear calls to action, and polite greetings.
2. **Resume**  
   Always a good backup plan.
3. **Blog**  
   This very log—because progress deserves an audience.
4. **Story**  
   A concise “About Me” narrative.
5. **Projects Portfolio**  
   Show, don’t just tell.
6. **…All Other Nifty Features**  
   Dark mode? Animated cursor? Maybe tomorrow.
