## Getting Started Quickly

I kicked things off at 11th Hour Coffee—because where else does one set up a laptop? With a latte in hand and ChatGPT whispering best practices, I prioritized maintainability over premature experiments (sorry, Cloudflare Workers… for now).

- **Template Choice**  
  I grabbed the official Next.js portfolio & blog template from Vercel—instant boilerplate, minimal headaches.  
- **Two‑Hour Sprint**  
  From a naked Mac with zero terminal setup to a localhost site on my custom domain (yes, it’s literally my name) in about two hours.  
- **ChatGPT Powered**  
  Helped me decide routes and architecture without over‑engineering.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Cloudflare**  
   Get the site live at westonmossman.com.  
2. **Deliverable Slices**  
   Push a basic starter site to potential leads—styling and bells & whistles come later.  
3. **CMS & Blog**  
   Plug in a CMS API, test new posts, and iterate on what’s easiest to manage.

### Analytics

- Define what success looks like before dropping in Google Analytics—or, you know, Plausible, Fathom, or whatever won’t make me lose sleep.

## Tech Stack Musings

- **TypeScript**: That sweet spot between “I hope this works” and “I can’t believe it caught that bug at compile time.”  
- **React**: JSX feels like mixing HTML and JavaScript in a Ritual of Productivity™.  
- **Next.js**: Opinionated file-based routing, built‑in SSR, and a community that doesn’t shy away from sensible defaults.

## Domain Name, DNS, Hosting

- **westonmossman.com**: Still available—proof that not everyone cares about hoarding domain names.  
- **Cloudflare DNS & Hosting**: One dashboard to rule them all, with the bonus of playing later with Workers and Durable Objects.
