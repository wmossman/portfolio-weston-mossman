For this project I built a relationship with the Executive Director and manager of a local Museum, brainstormed an installation for their 2025 Summer exhibit, designed the prototype within specs and manufacturing efficiency, and made the sale. The sale was ~20 times the value of Swellcycles average product price.

I helped guide production strategy, and continued by managing the customer relationship.

The installation was made of all recycled material, making the life-size enchanted tree a waste-negative piece.
