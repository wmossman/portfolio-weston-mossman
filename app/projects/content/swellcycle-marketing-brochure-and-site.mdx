I gathered info, strategized, designed, and finalized a waste-negative 3D printing contract manufacturing brochure and webpage for Swellcycle, leading to new partners and sales.

I used Miro and Photoshop. I used some AI generative fill to clean up the image alongside hand cleanup, you would never know!
