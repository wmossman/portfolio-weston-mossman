Novel interactive group workshops spanning 8 weeks per cohort, creating social accountability, mutual support, and tangible advice from facilitators that have deep life experience in the topics of the cohort, starting with myself as the first facilitator. Already have 5 additional facilitators in the realms of creative careers, persevering chronic health struggles, and climate adaptation.
