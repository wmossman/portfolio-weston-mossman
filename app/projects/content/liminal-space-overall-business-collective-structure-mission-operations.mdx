A wonderful tale of envisioning, founding and scaling a creative organization and business while redefining what it means to be a business.

Many, many mistakes were made, lessons learned, projects completed, impact realized, and lives changed on the road of mission manifestation.

This is the story of what it was like to transform an idea into a reality, then into something that connected thousands, all by the passion and intellect of those that led alongside me. The story of taking over a 16k Sqft, 150 year old church in the center of a neighborhood of concentric circles and transforming it into an immersive art space by 250+ artists with two full rebuilds, multiple festivals, and thousands of attendees, all over the course of 6 months. This is the story of losing that space to demolition, becoming a nonprofit, creating a collective charter, converging on a mission statement, and becoming a hotbed and a home for the creatives and changemakers on the fringe of social change, environmental stewardship, and cultural healing. This is the story of designing our own structures, operations and governance, learning from our mistakes and the millions of mentors of the world, and finally landing on the Producer Owned Cooperative we are today.

This is the story of loving something enough to build it, figuring it out as you go, making it work, sharing it with the world, staying strong when things inevitably get messy, building a formidable network of collaborators, beliving in yourself and your team, and growing into a fundamentally greater person, empowered AND humbled by the wisdom gleaned along the way. This is the story of leading a movement, building a community, creating an organization that is reslient, adaptable, decentralized, and coherent enough to survive and thrive without me. This is the story of letting go of what was, to allow for what can be.
