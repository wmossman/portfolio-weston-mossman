# Three.js Navigation Fix Test - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Description

The Three.js shader in NetworkHero component works on initial page load but breaks when navigating to a different page and back.

## Fix Applied

1. **Added initialization guard**: `isInitializedRef` prevents double initialization
2. **Added proper WebGL context handling**: Context loss/restore event listeners
3. **Improved cleanup process**:
   - Proper disposal of all Three.js objects
   - Force context loss on navigation to prevent WebGL issues
   - Clear all refs and arrays
   - Remove event listeners properly
4. **Enhanced render safety**: Check for context loss before rendering

## Test Results ✅

Successfully tested multiple navigation patterns:

- Home (/) → Projects (/projects) → Home (/) ✅
- Home (/) → DevBlog (/devblog) → Resume (/resume) → Home (/) ✅
- Multiple rapid navigation cycles ✅
- No compilation errors ✅
- No WebGL context errors ✅
- Consistent shader rendering across all navigation cycles ✅

## Key Changes Made

- Added `composerRef`, `contextLossHandlerRef`, `contextRestoreHandlerRef`
- Enhanced cleanup function to properly dispose WebGL context
- Added context loss prevention via forced context loss during cleanup
- Added safety checks in render loop
- Removed excessive debug logging for cleaner production code

## Status: RESOLVED

The fix addresses the common Three.js + React navigation issue where WebGL contexts become corrupted during page transitions. Navigation between pages now works seamlessly without breaking the NetworkHero shader.
